# Cloud Computing Projects (CSE 546 - Fall 2024)

This repository contains three individual cloud-based projects built using AWS services, showcasing different deployment models and architectures.

---

## üì¶ Project 1: AWS IaaS Basics

A foundational project to interact with AWS using SDKs to provision and manage resources like EC2, S3, and SQS. It demonstrates the full lifecycle of resource creation, usage, and teardown via automation.

---

## üîÅ Project 2: Elastic Face Recognition using IaaS

A multi-tier face recognition pipeline using EC2-based Web and App Tiers. Implements custom autoscaling, S3 for storage, and SQS for communication between tiers. Real-time image classification using a pre-trained model.

---

## ‚ö° Project 3: Serverless Video Processing using PaaS

A fully serverless video analysis pipeline built with AWS Lambda. It processes uploaded videos to identify faces using a multi-stage architecture with FFmpeg, OpenCV, and PyTorch, and uses S3 buckets to handle data flow across stages.

---

Each project is self-contained in its respective folder and includes instructions, code, and test assets.
